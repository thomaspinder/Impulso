"""THE posterior schema — the coefficient-block contract shared by both estimators.

`spec.py`'s PyMC graph and `conjugate.py`'s hand-built Dataset are separate
likelihood implementations by design (ADR-0011); what they share is only the
schema below. Each registers its reduced-form coefficient blocks under these
names and layouts, and every consumer — residual reconstruction, forecasting,
the scenario engines, identification schemes — reads them back through this
module's accessors instead of re-knowing the key strings by convention.

Variable layouts (all leading with the `(chain, draw)` sample dims):

* ``B`` — `(chain, draw, n, n*p)`: VAR lag coefficients with **lag-major**
  coefficient columns (the lag-1 block first, mirroring the `X_lag` hstack
  both estimators build their design matrix from).
* ``intercept`` — `(chain, draw, n)`: per-equation intercepts.
* ``B_exog`` — `(chain, draw, n, n_exog)`: contemporaneous exogenous
  coefficients; present only when the estimator consumed an exogenous block.

Not owned here: the volatility seam's ``L`` (owned by `volatility.py` /
`conjugate_volatility.py`) and the error-distribution seam's ``nu``
(owned by `observation.py`).
